# Install Antora

Installing Antora on your local development (virtual) machine doesn't take *too* much time, based on whether you install the tools directly.

**Please note:** if you just want to make text changes, then installing the [AsciiDoc Live Preview Plugin](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/editing-asciidoc-with-live-preview/), whether as a Browser plugin, or as part of your text editor or IDE, may be sufficient for your needs.

## Install The Antora Tools Locally

To install all the Antora tools on your local machine will take a bit of time and effort. Before you get started, make sure that your development machine is one of the [supported platforms](https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/install/install-antora/). Note, if possible, aviod using Windows as it more and more conflicts with extensions and tools.

Though your system may have installed `yarn`, package management and issuing the build must not use yarn but `npm` which is part of the node installation.

With the dependencies and Antora tools installed, youâ€™re ready to [build the documentation](./build-the-docs.md) locally.
